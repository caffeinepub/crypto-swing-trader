  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all 8 requirements (REQ-23 through REQ-30). Retry buttons with exponential backoff were added to error states in Dashboard and WatchlistPanel. Request batching was implemented in coingecko.ts using comma-separated coin IDs. TimeframeSelector was integrated into Dashboard header with state management. A comprehensive AI Trade Analysis card was created with real-time recommendation generation, displaying entry points, take-profit targets, stop-loss, confidence scores, risk levels, and reasoning. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the diff evidence.",
