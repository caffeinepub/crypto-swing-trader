  "summary": "The diff implements most visual trading marker requirements on the CandlestickChart component including entry points, take-profit levels, stop-loss markers, and pattern tooltips with cyberpunk styling. Trade recommendations are generated and passed to the chart. However, evidence for mobile optimization (REQ-54) is not present in the truncated diff.",

      "id": "REQ-54",
      "requirement": "Ensure all chart markers remain visible and readable on mobile devices with optimized touch interactions for pattern tooltips (tap instead of hover), appropriately scaled marker sizes and label fonts, and testing on various mobile screen sizes to prevent overlap",
      "reason": "No evidence of mobile-specific CSS media queries, touch event handlers (onTouchStart/onTouchEnd), responsive marker sizing, or mobile font scaling in the truncated CandlestickChart.tsx code",
