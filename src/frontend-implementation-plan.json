Display the entry point price from the recommendation object with appropriate currency formatting. Apply color coding: green (text-green-600 dark:text-green-400) for 'buy' direction, red (text-red-600 dark:text-red-400) for 'sell' or 'short' direction. Include a clear 'Entry Point' label using appropriate typography (font-semibold). If recommendation.entryReasoning exists, display it below the price. Use consistent spacing, icons (TrendingUp for buy, TrendingDown for sell), and font sizes to establish clear visual hierarchy that matches existing card patterns for take-profit and stop-loss displays. Ensure the entry point section is immediately visible and distinct from other card sections."
