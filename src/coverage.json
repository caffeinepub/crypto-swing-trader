The entry point should include: the price value with appropriate formatting, color coding (green for buy entry, red for sell/short entry based on recommendation direction), a label 'Entry Point', and the entry reasoning text if available. Ensure the entry point section uses clear visual hierarchy with appropriate spacing, icons, and typography to make it immediately visible to users.",
