# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add visual trading markers and interactive tooltips to candlestick charts to display AI-recommended entry points, take-profit levels, stop-loss positions, and pattern explanations.

**Planned changes:**
- Add entry point markers on candlestick charts (green neon arrows/lines for long positions, red neon arrows/lines for short positions with glow effects)
- Display three horizontal take-profit level lines (conservative, moderate, aggressive) with gradient neon green colors and labels
- Add stop-loss level marker as a horizontal line with neon red/orange color and warning indicator
- Implement hover tooltips for candlestick patterns showing pattern name, description, and recommended trading action
- Integrate chart markers with AI trade recommendation data for real-time synchronization
- Optimize all markers and tooltips for mobile devices with touch interactions

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see clear visual trading markers overlaid on candlestick charts showing exactly where to enter trades, where to set take-profit targets, and where to place stop-loss orders. Hovering over detected patterns reveals educational tooltips explaining what the pattern means and what action to take. All markers use cyberpunk neon styling with glow effects.
