# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Display the entry point price prominently in the AI Trade Analysis card so users can see where to enter a trade.

**Planned changes:**
- Add entry point section at the top of the AITradeAnalysisCard component, above take-profit targets
- Display entry point price with color coding (green for buy entries, red for sell/short entries)
- Include "Entry Point" label and entry reasoning text if available
- Apply clear visual hierarchy with appropriate spacing, icons, and typography

**User-visible outcome:** When users view AI trade analysis for a crypto, they will immediately see the recommended entry point price at the top of the card, along with take-profit targets and stop-loss information.
